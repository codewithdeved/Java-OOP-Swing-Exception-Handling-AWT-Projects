Q.No.2 (10 Marks)\

(a) Identify the difference between a class and an object in Java. How are they relatable? (4 Marks)

Answer:-

Class: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) 
that objects of the class share.

Example:

class Car {
    String model;
    void display() { System.out.println("Car Model: " + model); }
}

Object: An object is an instance of a class. It has a state (data) and behavior (methods).

Example:

Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.model = "Tesla";
myCar.display();

Relation: Objects are created based on the structure defined by a class.

(b) Construct the following pattern while using Java:

package MidtermPaper;

public class Pattern {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int n = 4;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                System.out.print(" ");
            }

            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                System.out.print(j);
            }

            for (int j = i - 1; j >= 1; j--) {
                System.out.print(j);
            }

            System.out.println();

        }

    }
