Q.No.3 (10 Marks)

(a) Explain the concept of abstraction in Java, and also discuss the advantage and disadvantage of 
using over other OOP principles. (4 Marks)

Answer:-

Abstraction: is the OOP principle of hiding implementation details while showing only the essential functionality. 
It can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

Example:

abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() { 
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle"); 
    }
}

Advantages:
1. Reduces complexity by hiding details.
2. Improves code reusability and maintainability.

Disadvantages:
1. Increased complexity when implementing abstract methods.
2. Requires careful design to ensure proper functionality.

(b) Write a Java program with a superclass Bird that has a method speak(), along with subclasses Parrot and Eagle. 
Demonstrate polymorphism. (6 Marks)

class Bird {
    void speak() {
        System.out.println("Bird is speaking");
    }
}

class Parrot extends Bird {
    @Override
    void speak() {
        System.out.println("Parrot says: Hello!");
    }
}

class Eagle extends Bird {
    @Override
    void speak() {
        System.out.println("Eagle says: Screech!");
    }
}

public class BirdDemo {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        Bird myBird1 = new Parrot();
        Bird myBird2 = new Eagle();

        myBird1.speak();
        myBird2.speak();

    }
